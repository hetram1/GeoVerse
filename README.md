# 🌍 REST Countries Explorer

A fully-featured, responsive React application that allows users to explore detailed information about countries using the REST Countries API. This project integrates multiple external APIs (Weather, News, Maps) and supports user authentication via Clerk for personalized experiences such as favorites.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This application was developed as part of the SE3040 – Application Frameworks course assignment. It demonstrates advanced usage of React functional components, RESTful API integration, responsive UI design using MUI, and session management.

> 📅 **Start Date**: April 4, 2025

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Vite), JavaScript
- **Styling**: Material UI (MUI)
- **Authentication**: Clerk.dev
- **APIs Used**:
  - 🌍 [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com)
  - 🌦️ [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/)
  - 📰 [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/)
  - 🗺️ [Google Maps Embed API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed)

## 🌐 API Endpoints Used

From the REST Countries API:
- `GET /all` – List all countries
- `GET /name/{name}` – Search by country name
- `GET /region/{region}` – Filter by region
- `GET /alpha/{code}` – Detailed country info by code
- ✅ Advanced filtering by:
  - Language
  - Currency
  - Region
  - Capital

External API data is fetched and displayed dynamically using user interactions.

---

## 🧑‍💻 User Features

## ⚡ Performance Improvements

This project includes several optimizations to improve performance, responsiveness, and user experience:

- ✅ **React Query (`useQuery`)**  
  - Caches API responses to avoid redundant network requests  
  - Deduplicates fetches across components  
  - Automatically refetches stale data in the background  
  - Manages loading and error states efficiently  

- ✅ **Axios with Efficient API Design**  
  - Centralized API functions for better control and error handling  
  - Limited API calls by reusing cached data wherever possible  

- ✅ **Debounced Search Input**  
  - Reduces API requests by waiting for user to stop typing before searching  

- ✅ **Popular Countries Optimization**  
  - Sorted and sliced most-populated countries from cached `/all` endpoint, avoiding extra API calls  

- ✅ **Component Memoization**  
  - Used `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders  

- ✅ **Image Lazy Loading**  
  - Country flag images are lazy-loaded with `loading="lazy"` to speed up initial page load  

- ✅ **Responsive & Optimized UI**  
  - Built with Material UI components that use CSS-in-JS for fast rendering and reduced styling overhead  
  - Layout adapts to all screen sizes to minimize unnecessary rendering on different devices  

- ✅ **Vite Dev Server & Production Build**  
  - Instant hot-reloading during development  
  - Production build includes tree-shaking, code splitting, and asset optimization  

- ✅ **Error Boundaries & Graceful Fallbacks**  
  - Ensures UI doesn't break on API failure and provides meaningful error feedback

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 🔐 Authentication Integration
- **Challenge**: Clerk's authentication flow needed careful integration with routing and protected components.
- **Solution**: Implemented React Context and hooks to handle session state and used Clerk-provided components to streamline user login/logout.

### 🌐 API CORS Restrictions
- **Challenge**: Encountered Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors when making requests to some APIs during local development.
- **Solution**: Configured Vite's development server to proxy requests, effectively bypassing CORS restrictions in dev mode.

### 📊 Data Overload & Performance
- **Challenge**: Rendering all country data (especially flags, maps, and additional API responses) in bulk led to performance issues.
- **Solution**: Implemented lazy loading for heavy components and optimized API requests to reduce redundant fetch calls.

### 📱 Responsive UI on All Devices
- **Challenge**: Ensuring a pixel-perfect layout across various screen sizes and browsers.
- **Solution**: Used MUI's responsive Grid system, breakpoints, and flexible design principles to provide a seamless experience across devices.

### 🔄 State Management
- **Challenge**: Managing multiple asynchronous API responses (weather, news, and country details) without blocking the UI.
- **Solution**: Used `useEffect` combined with conditional rendering, loading states, and error boundaries to maintain smooth interactions.

### 🔑 Secure API Key Handling
- **Challenge**: Needed to keep third-party API keys safe while developing and deploying.
- **Solution**: Used environment variables and `.env` files, ensuring keys never appeared in source control. On Vercel, used its Secrets management for deployment.
